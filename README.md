Bag data structures<br>
The Bag ADT<br>
<br>
Write an implementation for data structure Bag as a Java class, which is similar to a set, but it
may contain several instances of the same member. For example, {'to', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be'}
is a bag of words, which is equal to {'be', 'be', 'not', 'or', 'to', 'to'} (since order of members is
insignificant), but is unequal to {'be', 'not', 'or', 'to'} (since the number of instances is
significant). Adding a member increases the number of instances in the bag by one and
removing a member decreases the number of instances in the bag by one. The member is
deleted from the bag when it has no instances.<br><br>
Think that “how would you represent a bag without actually storing multiple instances of the
same member?” Your implementation should be efficient.<br><br>
Don’t forget that you cannot use any pre-written Java Api Class. You must write your own
code for data structures (You are allowed to use lab source codes that we examined so far.)<br><br>
Your implementation must be generic, i.e. your bag can accept any type of instances. (Use
Java Generics !)<br><br>
Your ADT should provide at least these operations:<br><br>
 add(T item) : Inserts item in the bag.<br>
 clear() : Removes all of the elements from this bag.<br>
 contains(T item) : Returns true if this bag contains the specified element and false
otherwise.<br>
 distictSize() : Returns the distinct number of elements in this bag. (For example, for
the bag {'to', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be'} distinctSize is 4)<br>
 elementSize(T item) : Returns the number of this item in this bag. (For example, for
the bag {'to', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be'} elementsize(‘be’) is 2)<br>
 isEmpty() : Returns true if this collection contains no elements.<br>
 remove(T item) : Removes a single instance of item from this bag and returns true if
it is present; otherwise returns false.<br>
 size() : Returns the total number of elements in this bag. (For example, for the bag
{'to', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be'} size is 6)<br>
 toString() : Returns a string that displays the elements in the bag.<br><br>
Please write a Test program (a separate Java class) proves that your container(bag) works
properly.
